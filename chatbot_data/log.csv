You will need to email the faculty internship coordinator, or the course instructor to register you for the course. For more details, you may email Prof. Karen Jin.  What are the best sources to look for an internship?  Students are encouraged to start their search on Handshake as most of the employers who posted their jobs are looking for UNH students. Students can also apply for jobs through the website of the company/organization they are interested in, or through job websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Hired. Do attend internship fair on both Manchester and Durham campus, and speak with family, friends, and faculty. Career and Professional Success office can help you with resume writing, interview coaching and other career advice.  Do I still need to take the course if I am currently working?  Yes, you do. Even if you are currently working or have worked in the past, you will still need to take the Internship Experience course as a degree requirement. However, you don\'t need to take another internship position if you are currently working in the field. You may use the applied research option of COMP690, or COMP892 to fulfill the internship requirements.  I did an internship last summer. Can I use that to cover the requirements for the course?  Unfortunately, you cannot use a past internship job to fulfill the course requirements. You must hold your internship position and work the required number of hours WHILE you are registered in the Internship Experience course.  How can I register my internship experience on Handshake?  It is mandatory for the student to register internship experience on Handshake to receive credits for this course. To do this follow these steps:  Login to Handshake  On top right corner, under Career Center go to Experiences  Click on ""Request an Experience"" and fill the form   Your internship experience must be approved by your site supervisor and your  course instructor  Make sure to include at least three well-developed learning objectives  If you have any questions related to registering your internship experience on handshake,  please contact Career and Professional Success office.  While working at my internship, do I need to do anything else for this course?  Yes, you must complete the following requirements to earn the credit.  Attend every scheduled class meeting  Submit weekly logs  Complete a final internship report  Give progress presentations during the class  Please check the specific course syllabus for meeting dates and additional details.  Do I need to write weekly logs every week? How many hours do I need to log?  Weekly logs are part of the internship course requirements. Weekly logs are due on every week you work at your internship, until you complete the hours at your internship necessary for the required credit hours. For undergraduate students, that is 150 hours for 4 credits of COMP690. For graduate students, the internship course is variable credits, the credit hour is roughly equal to 40 hours of internship work. For example, if you are enrolled in 3 credit hours of Internship Experience class then you must complete 120 hours of internship. You are not required, but highly recommended to continue with the weekly logs after you reach the total hours required based on your registered credits. Also, you don\'t need to submit any logs for the weeks you have not worked. For example, during a weeklong break from work.  Can I start my internship position before the Internship Experience course starts?  Yes. You may start your internship before the course starts, but you can count only up to 20% of the hours toward the total internship hours required, providing that you will complete the remaining hours during the same semester.  I just got an internship offer but the semester has already started, what shall I do?  You need to contact the faculty internship coordinator, prof. Karen Jin and let her know the situation. Depending on the timing of your offer, you may be allowed to late add into the internship course or arrange with the employer a later start day.  I am an F1 student, what do I need to request CPT Authorization with my internship?  To request CPT Authorization you will need the following items:  internship job description or job posting  internship offer letter  proof of your course registration (a screen shot of your registration in the Internship course will suffice if your name or UNH student ID number is visible)  Important Notes:  1. The internship offer letter must include your specific dates of employment. For example, if you are working for the duration of the Fall 24 semester, the dates you are eligible to work between are 8/26/2024 and 12//2019.  2. CPT authorization coincides with the semester dates. Employment cannot begin until the first day of the semester (usually around January 20th), therefore, there will be a 4 week period of time (approximately) that you cannot work in between semesters.  What are the steps to request CPT Authorization?  To request CPT Authorization, please follow these steps:  Meet with the Internship Advisor Professor Karen Jin <karen.jin@unh.edu> prior to submitting the OISS eForm.  Login to eOISS  Under F-1 Practical Training, choose “CPT Authorization Form”.  Complete the form and upload a letter from your employer describing your job title, responsibilities, place of employment, start/end dates and the number of hours you will work per week. Upload proof of registration for the internship class (a screen print of your registration will suffice). After you submit the eForm, the Internship Advisor will receive an automated email from OISS requesting their approval for your CPT. Once the Internship Advisor has approved your request, OISS will issue your new I20. An OISS Advisor must issue your I-20 before you can begin employment. Please submit the eForm and supporting documentation 7-10 days in advance of your start date.

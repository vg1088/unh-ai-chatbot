    {"question": "What should I do if my internship offer arrives after the semester begins?", "expected_answer": " If your internship offer arrives after the semester begins, you should still proceed to accept it, but you may need to check with your academic advisor or the internship coordinator about how it impacts your enrollment or credit requirements."},
    {"question": "I just got an internship offer but the semester already started; what now?", "expected_answer": "Contact Professor Karen Jin; you might be able to late-add to the course or adjust your start date."},
    {"question": "What if my internship start date is after the semester begins?", "expected_answer": "If your internship start date is after the semester begins, you can still enroll in the course, as long as you meet the required hours and complete the necessary assignments. Just be sure to communicate with your internship coordinator about your schedule and any adjustments needed for assignments."},
    {"question": "I'm an F1 student. How do I get CPT authorization for my internship?", "expected_answer": "To get CPT (Curricular Practical Training) authorization for your internship as an F1 student, you typically need to follow these steps:Consult Your Designated School Official, Get an Offer Letter, Complete CPT Application, Receive Updated I-20,  Start Your Internship."},
